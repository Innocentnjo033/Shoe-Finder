<h1>Nike</h1>

<p>Nike, established in 1964 by Bill Bowerman and Phil Knight as Blue Ribbon Sports and later rebranded as Nike in 1971, has emerged as a dominant force in athletic footwear and apparel globally. Throughout the late '70s and early '80s, the brand soared to prominence through groundbreaking designs such as the Waffle Trainer and innovative Air technology, which revolutionised the athletic shoe industry. In 1984, Nike embarked on a landmark partnership with basketball icon Michael Jordan, leading to the creation of the Air Jordan line. This collaboration transcended the basketball court, transforming sneaker culture and cementing the Air Jordan series as a symbol of unparalleled style and performance, remaining immensely sought-after and influential in the world of trainers.</p>

<p>The name Nike has a historical lineage that spans over 3,000 years, originating from Ancient Greece to Rome and eventually becoming associated with an American sportswear brand.
